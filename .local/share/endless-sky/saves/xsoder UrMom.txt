		description "Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the Galactic Stock Exchange were previously headquartered here, before a terrorist attack destroyed them and a large portion of the capital city as well."
		description "	Currently, a massive rescue and evacuation operation is underway in and around the capital to find and treat survivors and contain the radiation. As to be expected, the planet's supplies are running dangerously low, and what remains of Martini's government has called for civilian ships to help deliver goods and provisions for the operation."
		spaceport "Instead of the immaculate spaceport that Martini once sported, this temporary spaceport consists of randomly-scattered makeshift landing areas, in order to support the large number of Navy and civilian ships assisting with the rescue and evacuation operation."

Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet."
		description "	Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some coastal regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands."
		description "	Bourne is also the seat of government for the newly-formed Free Worlds."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings."
		description "Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

		description "Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."

		description "	For centuries the locals have tried to find a deposit of diamonds, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered."
		description "	The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
